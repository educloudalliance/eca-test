Live functional testing for ECA Beta environment
************************************************

Educloud Alliance is running a Beta environment which
runs the reference implementation of all components and
services mentioned in the ECA Documentation.

This repository contains the functional tests which are
run periodically to test the environment is working and
functioning properly.

Contributing tests
==================

If your service is somehow connected to ECA Beta environment
you can, and should, contribute tests which include your
service.

Good testcase is doing the exact same thing your users would
do when using ECA Beta and your service together.
